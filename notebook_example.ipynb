    "# Narnian DEMO\n",
    "During this experience, we will face some classical tasks in signal processing to introduce the world of NARNIAN. This tutorial will help the user to understand some basic interactions that can happen among different Agents, presenting a framework that is general and open to customization. We will define the Environment, its Streams and the behaviors of its inhabitant by defining Finite State Machines and we will also visualize the interactions among those agents through an online viewer.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the [first example](#One-signal,-one-repetition) we will show the case in which the Teacher shows the Student a single stream and, after this single repetition, asks him to repeat it. During the [second example](#Fixed-Playlist), the Teacher alternates two signals and finally ask the Student to repeat both of them. Finally, in the [last example](#Complete-Learning-Cycle) we will evaluate the simplest complete scenario in NARNIAN, where the Teacher asks the Student to both replicate the signals and to describe their own output. The lesson from the Teacher is repeated until the Student doesn't met a threshold on a given metric, set by the Teacher. Once the Student reaches the required level on the first signal, the Teacher moves to the second one."
